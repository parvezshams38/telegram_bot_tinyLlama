# telegram_bot_tinyLlama

This is a homework as part of the "Data Science Survival Skills" course at FAU Erlangen NÃ¼rnberg.

Here I have used telegram bot API to communicate with a telegram bot that I created. Once the message is received by the bot it is processed by TinyLlama LLM model. 

I have run this in GoogleColab to get GPU acceleration. 

The code is ready-to-use in GoogleColab or other hosting platforms online. You only need to change the TOKEN and thats all!
