# telegram_bot_tinyLlama

This is a homework as part of the "Data Science Survival Skills" course at FAU Erlangen NÃ¼rnberg.

Here I have used telegram bot API to communicate with a telegram bot that I created. Once user gives an input to the bot, it is passed to the python script running 
in GoogleColab where it is processed by TinyLlama LLM model. The generated response is then passed to the bot which it shows to the user.  

I have run this in GoogleColab to get GPU acceleration. 

The code is ready-to-use in GoogleColab or other hosting platforms online. You only need to install any package if needed (like python-telegram-bot) and change the TOKEN,  and thats all!
